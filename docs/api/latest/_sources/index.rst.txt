MLOpus API Reference
====================

This is a minimal API reference for `MLOpus <https://github.com/lariel-fernandes/mlopus>`_

It doesn't contain much but auto-generated docs from class and method docstrings.

As a starting point for learning MLOpus we highly recommend looking at the `tutorials <https://github.com/lariel-fernandes/mlopus/tree/main/examples>`_ and `architecture guide <https://github.com/lariel-fernandes/mlopus/tree/main/docs/architecture.md>`_ instead.
