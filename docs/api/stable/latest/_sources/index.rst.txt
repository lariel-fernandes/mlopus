MLOpus API Reference
====================

This is a minimal API reference for [MLOpus](https://github.com/lariel-fernandes/mlopus).

It doesn't contain much but auto-generated docs from class and method docstrings.

As a starting point for learning MLOpus we highly recommend looking at the
[tutorials](https://github.com/lariel-fernandes/mlopus/tree/main/examples)
instead.
